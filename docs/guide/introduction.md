## What is Awesome Starter? {#what-is-awesome-starter}

Awesome Starter is a curated list of awesome things related to starter templates. Create some interesting and practical project startup templates through [Create Preset CLI](#what-is-create-preset), and it can also help you manage your favorite project configurations.

For a long time, there has been a lack of a tool to manage the configuration of your own public and private projects, so with the birth of Create Preset, if you find it useful, [Welcome to give it a Star](https://github.com/awesome-starter/create-preset) !

## Compatibility Note {#compatibility-note}

Some preset project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version >=12.2.0 (e.g. Vite). However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.
